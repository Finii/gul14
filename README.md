# libgul

The general utility library contains often-used utility functions and types that form the foundation for other libraries and programs. The main fields covered by the library are:

  * String utilities
  * Concurrency Utilities
  * Time Utilities
  * Backports from new standard library extensions

# Building

Clone this repository:

        git clone ssh://git@stash.desy.de:7999/gul/libgul.git
        cd libgul

Use meson to configure the build you want to have. Build directory name can be what you want. If you use directories starting with 'build' they will be ignored by git. Examples:

        meson build
        meson -D tests=false build_without_tests
        meson --prefix=/usr -D buildtype=release build_rel
        meson -D buildtype=release -D unity=on build_rel_unity
        meson -D buildtype=release -D docs=false build_nodocs_rel
        CXX=clang meson build_clang

Afterwards enter you build directory and fire the build process:

        cd build_rel
        ninja
        ninja test
        ninja data/docs
        makeDdeb -D

## Testing

After configuring the build directory one can run all tests by

        ninja test

To generate a coverage report you need to specify ``-D b_coverage=true`` on the meson call for the build configuration. Then after running the tests the coverage report is generated by

        ninja coverage-html

Depending on the installed coverage tool the targets ``coverage-text`` and ``coverage-xml`` might also be there. To generate a coverage report the package ``gcov`` must be installed, and ``lcov/genhtml`` or *(recommended)* ``gcovr`` (>= 3.1) is used to generate the html pages.

## Notes

1. You can list all possible build configuration switches with ``meson configure`` in an existing build directory [1]. This command can also be used to change build configurations after the directory has been created. For example to decrease the warning level after the build directory has already been created: ``meson configure -D warning_level=1`` [1].
2. The configuration to be changed can immediately follow the ``-D`` for example ``-Dwarning_level=1``.
3. It's not necessary to call ``ninja`` before you call ``makeDdeb``. But of course you usually want to do a ``ninja test`` before you package.
4. ``makeDdeb`` has to be called in the build directory of choice (that has been usually created with buildtype = release). Note that a proper debian package needs the prefix to be set to /usr (see examples above)

[1] Use ``mesonconf`` if your meson is too old.

## Build configuration switches

In addidion to meson's standard switches there are:

    Option         Default Value  Possible Values  Description
    ------         -------------  ---------------  -----------
    docs           true           [true, false]    Generate documentation via doxygen
    tests          true           [true, false]    Generate tests
    deb-dev-name   @0@-dev        string           Debian package name for development package
    deb-name       @0@            string           Debian package name
    deb-vers-ext   false          [true, false]    Debian package will use external versioning


The ``deb-*name`` switch can be used to configure the debian package building process with non-standard packet names. The substring '@0@' will be replaced by the canonical packet name (i.e. 'libgul'). Although non-standard packages automatically conflict with standard packages care must be taken to keep the install target system consistent (i.e. install always only one variant of libgul).

The ``deb-vers-ext`` switch forces the package names and versions to be based on the latest 'git external tag'. This is a tag in the git repository that does not start with 'v'. It is expected to give the version number to use in the form ``DESCRIPTION_major_minor_patch``, where major, minor, and patch are positive integers.

Overview of maybe useful standard project options:

    Option         Default Value         Description
    ------         -------------         -----------
    prefix         /usr/local            Installation prefix
    libdir         lib/...               Library directory
    includedir     include               Header file directory
    datadir        share                 Data file (Doxygen website) directory
