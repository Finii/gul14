# libgul

The general utility library contains often-used utility functions and types that form the foundation for other libraries and programs. The main fields covered by the library are:

  * String utilities
  * Concurrency Utilities
  * Time Utilities
  * Backports from new standard library extensions

Here you find more detailed information on:

* [Building](#Building)
  * [Build configuration switches](#Build-configuration-switches)
  * [Default Configurations](#Default-configurations)
* [Testing](#Testing)
* [Coverage report generation](#Coverage-report)
* [Versioning](#Versioning)
  * [Version number examples](#Version-number-examples)


## Building <a name="Building"></a>

Clone this repository:

        git clone ssh://git@stash.desy.de:7999/gul/libgul.git
        cd libgul

Use meson to configure the build you want to have. A list of the [build options](#Build-configuration-switches) is given below. Build directory name can be what you want. If you use directories starting with 'build' they will be ignored by git. Examples:

        meson build
        meson -D tests=false build_without_tests
        meson --prefix=/usr -D buildtype=release build_rel
        meson -D buildtype=release -D unity=on build_rel_unity
        meson -D buildtype=release -D docs=false build_nodocs_rel
        CXX=clang meson build_clang

Typical build configurations can be easily summoned as detailed in [Default configurations](#Default-configurations) below.

Afterwards enter you build directory and fire the build process:

        cd build_rel
        ninja
        ninja test
        ninja data/docs

And then you might want to create a debian package _(Note 2)_:

        debuild
        makeDdeb -D

Packaging is closely coupled to how version information is extracted (see [Versioning](#Versioning) below). The debian/ files including the debian/changelog are autogenerated on configure time. You need to reconfigure your build directory if tags/versions/commits change afterwards.

_Notes:_

1. The configuration to be changed can immediately follow the ``-D`` for example ``-Dwarning_level=1``
2. ``debuild`` is the normal debian packager, ``makeDdeb`` is a custom tool used here
3. It's not necessary to call ``ninja`` before you call ``makeDdeb``. But of course you usually want to do a ``ninja test`` before you package
4. ``makeDdeb`` has to be called in the build directory of choice (that has been usually created with buildtype = release). Note that a proper Debian package needs the prefix to be set to /usr (see examples above)

### Build configuration switches <a name="Build-configuration-switches"></a>

You can list all possible build configuration switches with ``meson configure`` in an existing build directory [1]. This command can also be used to change build configurations after the directory has been created. For example to decrease the warning level after the build directory has already been created: ``meson configure -D warning_level=1`` (Use ``mesonconf`` if your meson is too old.)

A lot of the switches change the versioning behaviour, more information on the versioning is given in a [separate paragraph](#Versioning).

In addition to meson's standard switches there are:

    Option         Default Value  Possible Values  Description
    ------         -------------  ---------------  -----------
    docs           true           [true, false]    Generate documentation via doxygen
    tests          true           [true, false]    Generate tests
    deb-dev-name   @0@-dev        string           Debian package name for development package
    deb-name       @0@            string           Debian package name
    deb-vers-pack  false          [true, false]    Debian package name will contain version
    deb-vers-tag   v              string           Debian package uses git version tags starting with this

The ``deb-*name`` switch can be used to configure the debian package building process with non-standard packet names. The substring '@0@' will be replaced by the canonical packet name (i.e. 'libgul'). Although non-standard packages automatically conflict with standard packages care must be taken to keep the install target system consistent (i.e. install always only one variant of libgul).

The ``deb-vers-ext`` switch forces the package names and versions to be based on the latest 'git external tag'. This is a tag in the git repository that does not start with 'v'. It is expected to give the version number to use in the form ``DESCRIPTION_major_minor_patch``, where major, minor, and patch are positive integers.

The ``deb-vers-pack`` switch appends the version number to the library and package names.

The ``deb-vers-tag`` option specifies how git tag start that are considered as version number tags. Tags selected here shall have a number after their start, in the form ``[0-9]+[._][0-9]+([._][0-9])?``. The actual version is deduced from this and the changelog walks the git repository to find previous versions that fit this pattern. Note that only the startstring is used to identify these tags, that they conform to the given regex is to be ensured by the user.

Overview of maybe useful standard project options:

    Option         Default Value         Description
    ------         -------------         -----------
    prefix         /usr/local            Installation prefix
    libdir         lib/...               Library directory
    includedir     include               Header file directory
    datadir        share                 Data file (Doxygen website) directory

### Default configurations <a name="Default-configurations"></a>

Some typical build configurations can be set up, all are in build directories under ``build/`` with the following commands:

* ``make release`` builds the release version of the library under build/x86\_64-linux-gnu/release
* ``make debug`` builds the debug version of the library under build/x86\_64-linux-gnu/debug
* ``make doocs-release`` builds a DOOCS release version that can be packaged with makeDdeb under build/x86\_64-linux-gnu/doocs-release
* ``make test`` runs unit tests on the release version
* ``make BUILDTYPE=debug test`` runs unit tests on the debug version
* ``make test-junit`` runs unit tests and generates output in JUnit XML format under build/x86\_64-linux-gnu/release/test.xml
* ``make JUNIT_XML_FILE=a.xml test-junit`` runs unit tests and generates output in JUnit XML format in the specified file
* ``make clean`` cleans up the build files of the release version
* ``make BUILDTYPE=debug clean`` cleans up the build files of the debug version
* ``make mrproper`` removes all build directories completely
* ``make doc`` builds documentation under build/x86\_64-linux-gnu/release/resources/doxygenerated (needs Doxygen)
* ``make localinstall`` makes a local installation of the library under /home/Ubuntu-16.04-x86\_64/lib

## Testing <a name="Testing"></a>

After configuring the build directory one can run all tests by

        ninja test

To see which tests have failed and get other additional information you might want to do instead

       meson test --test-args '-r junit'

Or for older meson versions

       mesontest --test-args '-r junit'

## Coverage report <a name="Coverage-report"></a>

To generate a coverage report you need to specify ``-D b_coverage=true`` on the meson call for the build configuration. Then after running the tests (see previous paragraph) the coverage report is generated by

        ninja coverage-html

Depending on the installed coverage tool the targets ``coverage-text`` and ``coverage-xml`` might also be there. To generate a coverage report the package ``gcov`` must be installed, and ``lcov/genhtml`` or *(recommended)* ``gcovr`` (>= 3.1) is used to generate the html pages.

## Versioning <a name="Versioning"></a>

The versioning of libgul can be divided into two entities:
* the API version
* the packet version

While the API version is also hard-coded in the main meson.build file the version numbers are embedded in the git repository. Git tags are used to identify a specific version. These tags are parsed and determine the two versions from above. The tags shall be annotated git tags, to preserve information on the tagger and tag date.

While the API version is fixed to tags starting with 'v' (e.g. ``v3.5``) the packet version can examine a different/custom set of tags. Normal Debian packets of course have the same (base) version as the API.

The first tag family donates the API version of the package that is in effect starting with the tagged commit. The version uses semantic versioning, and the format is defined as ``v1.2`` where 1 is the major, 2 the minor version-part. It always starts with a lower case ``v``. This tag is cross checked with the project version number given in the main meson.build file.

The API version patchlevel is automatically determined from the number of commits since the API version tagged commit, and added where appropriate as third number.

Package versioning can be based on that API version tags, or on any other tags set that start with the same text. Normal packets use the API tags. If another tag is desired the ``deb-vers-tag`` prefix must be specified.

That tags are used to tag specific points in time when a packet has been created from the project. Its form is ``name_1_2_3``, and again 1, 2, and 3 donate version number parts, that might or might not be semantic (see recommended format as regex in the description of the deb-vers-tags option). These tags can be used to create packet names in the form libgul-1.2.3 (with ``-D deb-vers-pack=true`` set in meson). Note that the ``name_`` part is ignored and can be arbitrary, as long as it does not start with lower case 'v'. The amount of numbers is arbitrary and just all ``_`` or ``.`` get substituted by ``-`` resp. ``.`` to fit required formats.

Here again a patchlevel is determined by the number of commits since the packet version tagged commit, and added where appropriate as either a semantic versioning patchlevel (i.e. third number) or explicit patchlevel (i.e. added ``p<number>``)

The packaging rules prevent building dirty repositories. Commit your changes first.

### Version number examples <a name="Version-number-examples"></a>

The versioning related switches work in the following way. Assume that the api version tag is ``v0.1`` and it is 3 commits behind; and the external tag version is ``D_18_11_7`` and it is 5 commits behind.

    deb-vers-tag   dev-vers-pack
        'v'            false            libgul_0.1.3.deb                       ->   libgul.so.0.1
        'v'            true             libgul-0-1_0.1.3.deb                   ->   libgul.so.0.1.3
        'D_'           false            libgul_18.11.7.p5.deb                  ->   libgul.so.18.11.7
        'D_'           true             libgul-18-11-7_18.11.7.p5.deb          ->   libgul.so.18.11.7.p5
