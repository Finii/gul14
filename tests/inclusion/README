Inclusion Test
--------------

This directory contains minimal compilation units, that include just one gul
header file and try to use each function / instantiate all function templates
at least once.  No standard or other headers should be included. In this way
we can check if the header files are self-sufficient and do not depend on
anything no explicitly mentioned.

The files in here are just compiled but never used/executed.
All objects are linked into a static library, that is discarded.
